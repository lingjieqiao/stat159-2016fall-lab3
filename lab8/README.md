### Shiny Document

This repository holds the information of Course Stats 159 at UC Berkeley, fall 2016 - lab No.8. This lab helps to understand the processing of creating an interactive shiny document by exploring relationship between `Sales` and three advertising channels `TV`, `Radio` and `Newspaper`.  

Course website: [gastonsanchez.com/stat159](http://gastonsanchez.com/stat159)

The file structure of this repository:
```
lab8/
	README.md
	app.R                 # code that creates ShinyDoc
	Advertising.csv       # data set downloaded
```
**ShinyDoc**, which is created by the code in app.R, is based on the simple linear regression between two variables. The ShinyDoc will have a dropdown with a list of 3 options - TV, Radio and newspaper as an input element. The output will be a scatter plot between `Sales` and the input option chosen from the dropdown.
